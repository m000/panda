/**
 * @brief TBA
 *
 * In linux, launching a new process typically involves:
 *   - `sys_clone` to setup a new process.
 *   - `sys_execve` follows shortly after, to load the new process image.
 *     The system call will start but will not return if successful.
 *   - A context switch happens where the task is still in a transient state.
 *   - In the first system call after the context switch (typically a `sys_brk`)
 *     the task has been updated and can be introspected via the `osi` api.
 *
 * @note XXX: Signature should have target_ptr_t as the type of all arguments.
 * However, syscall_parser.py doesn't emit target_ptr_t for strings/pointers.
